This is a project made for the course of Machine Learning and Data Mining at University of Brescia.

The problem chosen is the prediction of the obesity level of some people given information about their eating habits and level of physical activity.

The goal of the project is to create a classifier model and analyze the results of different classifiers.

The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919306985#bib1).

In our project we used these classifiers:

- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- Voting Classifier
- Adaboost

More information about the implementation and results can be found in [this](jupiter_notebook.ipynb) notebook.
